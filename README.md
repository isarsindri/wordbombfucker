This program comes in two variations. 
It comes in a UI with a scrollable textbox and a few other options, allowing you to minimize it and resize the UI as you'd like.
The other option is the one that runs in the command prompt.

This program is open-sourced encouraging people to learn from my code or use the code to create something else. I don't gatekeep many things, especially not on small projects.
